<p>The objective of this article is to predict flight prices given the various parameters.This will be a regression problem since the target or dependent variable is the price(continuous numeric value).Nowadays, the number of people using flights has increased significantly.It is difficult for airlines to maintain prices since prices change dynamically due to different conditions.That's why we will try to use machine learning to solve this problem.This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain.It can also help customers to predict flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.</p>
